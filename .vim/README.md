Yes, fuck plugins. This is a lot better.

If you want a bloated Vim that looks good as well, try:
https://github.com/dizaztor/dotfiles/blob/8f295003c0e3b18159961c1856984d49bc185adb/.vim/.vimrc

It's about 420 lines.



If you wanna try something else, try OneDark:
https://github.com/dizaztor/dotfiles/blob/dc43a7f1ff6b3e04985bda549f434e40b0384459/.vim/.vimrc

This .vimrc is about 153 lines.
